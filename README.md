distributed_prime_number_computation
====================================

A program to computer prime numbers across multiple computers and threads. The server is robust enough to handle client dropouts. The clients will shutdown if the server shutsdown.



This program can easily be run through the bash script that's included. This will however only work on Linux and Mac.
